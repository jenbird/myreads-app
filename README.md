## Project Background

This was project 7 in phase 2 of the Google Udacity Scholarship studying for a Udacity Nanodegree in Front End Web Development.

In this project we were given a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. We had to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template using React.

New JS files were created for each component and import/require statements were used when needed.

## Instructions

Download all files locally.
In your terminal:
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
React app will start automatically on its own server.

The project uses a Backend Server run via the provided file: [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js)

## Dependencies

* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
